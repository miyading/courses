CPSC 210 Personal Project (2019 Winter)
A user-centered Repertoire APP with Graphical User Interface. The Repertoire APP is designed to enhance a musician's day-to-day practicing. The musician can load their repertoire, make changes to a specific piece, add more pieces as assigned, listen to a particular piece before practicing, and save their daily progress using this APP. For each piece in the repertoire, the user can specify its anticipated tempo and its estimated practice time, and label its urgency/priority in order to plan out a better practice schedule. The APP is currently capable of playing any of 443 the midi audio files (Bach Chorales, Chopin Preludes, or Joplin Rags) in the repository upon request. Additional features include a visual metronome, as well as an additional frame to retrieve further web analysis for the user's favorite movement of any Mozart Sonatas of the day (KernScores). The construction adheres to software design principles and has been tested for its robustness.
